# Database-Design-and-Implementation-of-Quantas-Airways
This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of designing and implementing a fully optimized relational database system adhering to enterprise standards.

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):
Designed a detailed ER Diagram capturing entities, relationships, cardinality, attributes, and participation accurately based on business rules. Entity types and relationships were carefully identified, and normalization principles were applied to ensure minimal redundancy and data integrity.

Relational Model Conversion:
Applied a systematic ER-to-Relational Model conversion algorithm, resulting in a well-structured relational schema. Key aspects like primary keys, foreign keys, and integrity constraints were implemented to maintain robust relationships and data consistency across tables.

Database Implementation:
Developed database tables in an enterprise-grade relational database management system. Business rules were enforced through schema design, including constraints like unique keys, check constraints, and default values to align with the application requirements.

Advanced SQL and PL/SQL Development:
Designed and executed optimized SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and analysis. Developed advanced triggers, stored procedures, and functions using PL/SQL to automate business logic, enforce data consistency, and improve performance.
